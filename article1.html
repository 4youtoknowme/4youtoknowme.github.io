          <h1>“Ha ho jayega” — A story we tell ourselves.</h1>
          <p>I love this scene from Kung Fu Panda, where Master Shifu gives the Dragon Scroll to Po, the panda. The Dragon Scroll is believed to reveal the secrets of the world to the one who reads it, as it was created by Master Oogway — the founder of Kung Fu itself. Po was destined to read the holy scripture and become The Dragon Warrior. When his moment finally came his hands were shivering, and every pair of eyes in the temple begged for a glimpse of what Po was about to witness. With a dramatic reveal, the scroll is finally opened, almost blinding everyone with its glare. Much to Po’s surprise, he sees his own reflection — nothing else.</p>
          <p>The central idea in Taoism is represented by the symbol of Yin and Yang: two seemingly opposite but complementary forces acting in harmony to create order. The Taoists believe that the world is made up of the tangible and the intangible; together they construct reality.</p>
          <p>Yuval Noah Harari, in his seminal work Sapiens — A Brief History of Humankind, talks about the concept of constructed reality — how our ability to imagine, visualise, and believe in ideas was a giant leap for our species.</p>
          <p>I have a vivid recollection of how it felt when I got my first pay. It was June 2025, Delhi at its hottest. I had just finished my third year in college. Some of my friends were planning to drop out, some were giving the fourth year a shot. I was in the latter group, obviously. It was still the summer vacation, but I decided to stay in the city to figure out my life. I had just been humbled in matters of love, and it did nothing to ease the chaos or the staggered self-belief I was carrying.</p>
          <p>I remember getting a call from one of my seniors, Prateek Bhaiya. He wanted me to cover Abhimanch Theatre Society’s upcoming play Peepal Ki Chhaon Mein. He didn’t have time, and I needed money to fund my upcoming marathon in Spiti — we were a match made in heaven (sighs and smiles). Soon after, I hopped on a call with Akash Tyagi, the play’s director. He explained what he needed, and I tried to pull off a Jordan Belfort on him. He actually helped me do that. I managed to convince him not just for the video-shooting part but, as I recall, a “complete creative solution” — from start to finish. The pay jumped from 2–3 thousand to 8 after some bargaining.</p>
          <p>Funny enough, the moment I ended the call, I rushed to my laptop, opened YouTube and typed: “How to shoot video on a camera?” Let alone the fact that I still needed to arrange a camera. None of that mattered though. I had already promised everyone — Ha ho jayega — as if I was born doing this.</p>
          <p>It was me and Prateek, my friend whom I managed to convince to click photos for a cut of the deal. We reached Akshara Theatre. I had my hand-stitched and coloured Converse on, along with a custom tote that one of my juniors had gifted me. If fashion is how one communicates, I must have been screaming. We were ready — and it began.</p>
          <p>Twelve-plus hours of figuring things out, problem-solving, and improvising later, we called it a day. The play was a sight to behold. Better was still coming though. After everything was wrapped up, we met Akash, who was bidding farewell to the last few members of the audience. He smiled, thanked us, and transferred me 8,000 rupees.</p>
          <p>That day, something shifted. We were bouncing our way back toward the metro to save money. With the cool breeze cutting across our faces from the fast-moving traffic, Delhi felt like an entity of its own. Gleaming in the backdrop with its nightlife, our bright faces must have added the glow of an incandescent bulb or two to it. That day, I realised how much of what we call reality is constructed inside our heads — a story that changes slightly every time it plays, repeating until our deathbeds. It is shaped by hope, belief, and repetition.</p>
